In this animation Two stream Instabiity is shown.
When two electron beam move in opposite direction they create this instability.

Content of this repo are:
1. Very much efficient and accurate Boris-Pusher code.
2. Field solving algorithm (Partilce interpolation and field weighting is done by Cloud in Cell (CIC) method and Inverse CIC respectively.
3. 1D particle in cell code (Two stream Instabilty)
4. 2D Particle in cell Method (Not yet finished -- Under coding)
